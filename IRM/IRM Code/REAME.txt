Setup Requirements:
1. Python
2. Python Package MySQL DB
3. ITS databases

To run:
1. Open test.py, change semester string to the desired semester, set the T value to desired (.5 recommended)
2. Ouput table is intelligent_review_ + semester_string
For example "Fall 2013" -> intelligent_review_Fall_2013

Classes versus explained math in paper:
1. concept_stats.py is from internal analysis
2. user_stats.py is from user analysis
3. crit_score.py is from quantifying criticalness
4. intelligent_review.py is from constructing review trees

Notes:
1. its_insert_file_name_her are for helper classes for DB
2. cross_correlation and total cross_correlation should be transition potential and totel transition potential. Notation in the paper changed, classes not updated.
