Intelligent Review Model: Top level README

Each folder, the 3 projects have there own README

1. Intelligent Review Model Code /IRM Code/
	a. ITS_table/ITS_query handle writing tables, and querying database
	b. concept_stats - System Analysis (Paper)
	c. user_stats - User Analysis (Paper)
	d. crit_score - Quantifying Criticalness (Paper)
	e. intelligent Review - Buildiing Review Trees (Paper)
	
Notes:

	Run test.py to build table -'intelligent_review_semester_id' inputs
	are semester id, and T. T = .5 recommended
	
	
	All references to cross corrolation should be to transition 
	potential. Notation of the paper changed and the code was not
	updated to reflect the change in nomenclature. However, works as
	intended. For example tcs ->tps. (Sorry - out of time)

2. Intellient Review GUI /GUI/

3. Intelligent Review Model Optimization /Optimization/

Notes:
	Seems to be an issue with the implementation, not producing the
	predicted results from excel. Needs investigation. The excel model
	is fine. Should be placed in the crit_score class (Raw data only
	in concept_stats).
